We spent the day at Hartleys Crocodile Adventures. Personally I'm not sure what I think about this place, I guess I don't know enough to make a judgement call but it just seems to me that it all can't be great for the animals. 

They do a great job of educating people and do rescue animals so I'm not totally sure whether they are doing the 'right' thing or not.
