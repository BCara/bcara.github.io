## Iguazu Falls - Brazil

The day we arrived we dropped our stuff off and got back on the same bus (120) that we had used to get from the airport and headed straight to the falls. Once at the entrance we waited in line for a bus that took us to a trek that lead to the main falls. As soon as we got off the bus we noticed a few Raccoon type creatures which were really quite cute. However, according to the signs they can be quite vicious. We carried on down the 1.5km trek which followed the river. It was a beautiful walk but unfortunately there were a lot of people and because of this it wasn't as serene as it could have been. We went about midday so maybe a better time to go would have been in the morning. 

Once you get to the end of the trek there's a bridge that takes you into the middle of the river where you get a fantastic view of the falls from the bottom along with a lot of water spray. It's magnificent seeing how big the falls are when you are stood right in the middle. 

It was at this point I started getting texts about Internet usage. I am on a three contract and am able to use my inclusive minutes in Brazil but not in Argentina. Now I was still in Brazil but stood extremely close to the border so my phone must have picked up an Argentinian signal and started charging me. Ahhh by the end of the trip I had Â£24 internet service charges. What a way to make a beautiful stunning experience turn sour. Fortunately, I rang three and they reimbursed me completely!! 

All in all it was an amazing day with the Brazil side of the falls being truly stunning!

## Itaipu Dam - Paraguay

The following day we decided to nip into Paraguay and visit the Itaipu Dam. It is possible to do this trip from Brazil but after doing some research it looked as though the cheapest option was Paraguay as their tour around the dam is free. 

We started our journey into Paraguay and Joe started to panic as we passed the border. If you are on a public bus they don't stop at the border so you just go along through. However, this appeared to be the norm.

We ended up getting off the bus at the last stop which was the complete wrong stop and struggled to work out how to get to the Dam as no one spoke English. At this point we had no map or translator downloaded but some how managed to work out where to get a Taxi. Fortunately, the Itaipu dam visitor center had WiFi so we were able to plan the route back to Brazil and download a translator.

The Dam itself was amazing to see, a lot bigger than I had expected. We went on a tour bus around the site but unfortunately the tour was in Spanish. The Dam itself produces 80% of Paraguay's electricity and 20% of Brazil's so it is some pretty impressive engineering.

Walking through Ciudad del Este to find the bus back to Brazil we picked up a stray puppy. The puppy followed us for what must have been 2km before we finally managed to lose it. It is a good job we didn't have our own car or Joe would definitely have tried to bring him home!

## Iguazu Falls - Argentina 

To get from Brazil to Argentina we hopped on a bus from Foz du Iguazu (Brazil) to Puerto Iguazu (Argentina) and this time the bus did stop at the border. This was pretty straight forward although 3 busses did drive past leaving us stoof in the rain for 1.5 hours. Fortunately the bus did eventually stop and we had no futher problems as we only had enough Brazilian Real for the bus so we weren't left with too much unwanted cash. 

From Puerto Iguazu it was straight forward to get the bus to the falls. The price for the falls on the Argentinian side was more expensive than for the Brazil side but it's definitely worth it to see the falls from a different perspective. From this side you end up walking over a bridge on top of the falls whereas on the Brazil side you walk into the middle at the bottom of the falls.

We got to the National Park with what we thought was enough time to see the falls and do a small trek before we needed to get our flight. However, it ended up taking ages to get to the main area for the falls as you have to take a train and it's some distance away. We ended up having to race our way through the park to ensure we got back and to the airport on time. It was a shame we had to rush our way around but even for a short time the spectacular view was worth it.




















## A Week in Port Douglas
**Exploring Tropical Wonders and Coastal Charm**

Nestled in the heart of Tropical North Queensland, Port Douglas proved to be a captivating destination for our week-long adventure. From the ancient beauty of the Daintree Rainforest to the vibrant underwater world of the Great Barrier Reef, our journey was filled with awe-inspiring moments and unforgettable experiences.

**Exploring Daintree:**

Embarking on our exploration of the Daintree Rainforest, a UNESCO World Heritage site, was a transformative escape from city life. The ancient forest enveloped us with lush greenery and the symphony of diverse wildlife. While the elusive cassowaries remained hidden during our visit, the prospect of encountering these majestic birds heightened our excitement.

Traversing the well-kept boardwalks allowed us to immerse ourselves in the heart of this natural wonder, surrounded by the enchanting melodies of birdsong and the rustle of unseen creatures in the foliage.

Our journey extended to Cape Tribulation, where rainforest meets reef. A leisurely walk along the pristine beach unveiled captivating views of mangroves gracing the shoreline. Reaching a designated viewing spot, the convergence of the Coral Sea's azure waters and the rainforest's lush greenery showcased nature's exquisite balance.

This exploration wasn't just a foray into a captivating environment; it was a profound encounter with Earth's oldest living rainforest. The serene ambiance, the anticipation of wildlife, the intricate boardwalks, and the stunning coastal views made our time in the Daintree Rainforest and Cape Tribulation an unforgettable communion with nature's grandeur.

**The Great Barrier Reef Expedition:**

Undoubtedly the pinnacle of our journey was the Quicksilver tour to the Great Barrier Reef. A day brimming with exploration and aquatic marvels awaited us as we set out to a floating platform, a gateway to the mesmerizing underwater world. The prospect of adventure unfolded, and while some fellow travelers opted for the depths of scuba diving, our choice was to snorkel. Immersing ourselves in the azure expanse, we found ourselves surrounded by a kaleidoscope of colors, as vibrant coral formations and an array of marine life painted a breathtaking scene beneath the surface.

The floating platform itself was a hub of activity, offering not only a base for aquatic adventures but also a gastronomic delight. The buffet spread presented a delightful feast, a perfect interlude between our underwater escapades. As we reveled in the flavors and exchanged stories of our snorkeling exploits, the platform's underwater museum beckoned. However, this submerged section, though offering unique perspectives through its windows, fell somewhat short of the immersive experience provided by the vibrant marine life encountered during our snorkeling endeavors and the captivating submarine tour.

**Seaside Adventures:**

Port Douglas offered more than just underwater wonders. The turquoise waters of Four Mile Beach beckoned, and we couldn't resist the opportunity to take a dip between the barriers. During stinger season, a protective net ensured our safety. The warm and wavy sea felt like a natural wave machine, adding an extra element of excitement to our beach day.

**Exploring the Tip and Local Markets:**

A leisurely walk around the tip of Port Douglas rewarded us with stunning coastal views. The refreshing sea breeze and panoramic landscapes made it a perfect way to unwind. To experience the local culture and indulge in some retail therapy, we explored the vibrant markets. The stalls were filled with unique handmade crafts, local produce, and a lively atmosphere that reflected the laid-back charm of Port Douglas.


Our week in Port Douglas was a perfect blend of natural wonders, aquatic adventures, and cultural explorations. From the majestic Daintree Rainforest to the colorful coral formations of the Great Barrier Reef, every moment was a celebration of the incredible beauty that Tropical North Queensland has to offer. Port Douglas, with its warm hospitality and diverse experiences, left an indelible mark on our travel memories.
